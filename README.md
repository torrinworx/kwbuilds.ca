# KWBuilds.ca
Browse local projects, see what you're friends and neighbours are building!

Everything from startup ideas, to fun weekend projects. Ask for help or offer a helping hand! I want to build a community where local founders and builders can find collaboraters and cofounders.

KW and Canadian culture in general could benifit from more public forms and spaces to meet people. I want this site to be meeting place for techies and entraprenures to meet and collaborate and get a feel for what is being built around them in their communities.

How it works:
- You sign up
- You post something like "Hey, I'm building this open source project/startup idea/hobby."
- people can browse and reach out. We encourage people to meetup irl over coffee to discuss their ideas and projects
- The goal isn't jobs. This isn't a job board, nor is it a pitch board. This is a place where people can keep a pulse on the ideas flowing around our community.
